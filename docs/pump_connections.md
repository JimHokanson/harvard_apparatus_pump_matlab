# Serial Ports! Physically Connecting to the Pumps #

Remember [serial ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port)? It has certainly been since computers shipped with a [DE-9  connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature). A quick Google search suggests that around 2004 these connectors and the accompanying serial connection was no longer being installed on connectors.

This means that in order to connect to a serial interface running the RS-232 (or similar) communication protocol, an adapter for the computer will be needed. Fortunately, USB to serial adapters are readily available online. A short cable on the order of [$10 should be fine](https://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-Converter-Installation-Universal-TU-S9).
